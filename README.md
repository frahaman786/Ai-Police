🖼️ AI Image Detector
An AI-powered Image Detection Web App built with React.js and Gemini API.
This project allows users to upload or paste image URLs, and the AI detects and describes objects, scenes, or text present in the image.
🚀 The goal is to create a simple yet powerful AI image recognition tool, with plans to add more advanced features in the future (translation, summarization, speech output, etc.).

✨ Features
📷 Upload  → Detect objects in images.
🤖 AI-Powered → Uses Google Gemini API for detection & description.
⚡ Fast & Reliable → Built with React + Vite/CRA (depending on your setup).
🎨 Clean UI → Minimal and user-friendly interface.
